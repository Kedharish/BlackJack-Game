Hi there! I'm a self-taught Python developer passionate about programming. I'm currently working on various projects, including a Blackjack game, where the goal is to get a card total of 21 without exceeding it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to connect. Reach me on LinkedIn: Kedharish.
